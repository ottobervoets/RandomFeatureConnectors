1) Generate the maps

2) store conceptors

3) recalculate the maps.


How to measure if it is able to store extra pattern?

Adding extra dimention and rest two zero would atleast work as well.
In other case, just base the mappings on a subset of the patterns.
In each case step 1 can be done with only a subset, and the other 2 steps with the remaining part.
